Project Plan: Dynamic Blog Website

Objectives:
- Develop a multi-page blog website with CRUD functionality.
- Use JavaScript to manage posts via local storage.
- Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- Ensure the design is responsive.

Milestones:

1. Setup and Initialization:
   - Create a new project directory.
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Create a GitHub repository and link it to the local repository.
   - Create initial HTML files (e.g., index.html, create.html).
   - Create initial CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Make the first commit with the basic file structure.

2. Read and Display Posts (READ):
   - Implement JavaScript to retrieve posts from local storage.
   - Create a function to display posts on the homepage (index.html).
   - Style the homepage to display a list of posts with titles and a brief summary.
   - Add a commit for the 'Read' functionality.

3. Create New Posts (CREATE):
   - Design the 'create.html' page with a form for new blog posts (title, content).
   - Implement JavaScript to handle form submission.
   - Store the new post data in local storage.
   - Redirect the user back to the homepage after creation.
   - Add a commit for the 'Create' functionality.

4. Update and Delete Posts (UPDATE & DELETE):
   - Add 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons to each blog post displayed on the homepage.
   - Implement JavaScript to handle the 'Delete' functionality, removing the post from local storage.
   - Implement JavaScript for the 'Edit' functionality, pre-filling the form on a new page or a modal with the existing post data and saving the changes back to local storage.
   - Add a commit for the 'Update and Delete' functionality.
   
5. Responsive Design and Finalization:
   - Use CSS media queries to ensure the website is responsive on various screen sizes.
   - Review and refine the styling of all pages.
   - Test all CRUD functionalities to ensure they work correctly.
   - Make a final commit for the responsive design and final touches.
   - Push all changes to the GitHub repository.
